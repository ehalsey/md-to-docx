# MBC Scheduling, EHR, and Clinical System - Functional Requirements

## Overview
As a foundational component of the MBC Scheduling, EHR, and Clinical system, these functional requirements define the core capabilities needed to streamline patient intake, referral management, scheduling, clinical documentation, and supporting processes. These requirements directly address current pain points, such as manual dual entry and fragmented workflows, while promoting efficiency, data accuracy, and user-friendly interfaces for intake coordinators, schedulers, providers, and billing staff. Prioritization focuses on MVP features essential for house accounts like STR and LY, with desired enhancements noted for future scalability.
